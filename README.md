# Spell Checker Readme
This is a spell checking application that uses the JLanguageTool library to detect and correct spelling errors in text. The application is built with a Spring Boot back-end and a React front-end.

## Prerequisites

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:DrBepso/SpellChecker.git
```

## Back-end
Navigate to the backend directory and build the project using Maven by running the following command:

```
mvn clean install
```
Start the back-end server by running the following command:
```

```
## Front-end
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies using npm by running the following command:
```
npm install
```
Start the front-end development server by running the following command:
